# Spam Detection AI: Email Classification System

## Project Overview  
A machine learning solution that identifies spam emails with **96.7% accuracy**, combining technical rigor with modern development practices. Built for both effectiveness and resume impact.

---

### Core Features  
üîç **Advanced NLP**: TF-IDF vectorization for text analysis  
üìà **Optimized Model**: Logistic Regression classifier  
üìÇ **Quality Data**: 5,572 messages from the [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)  

---

## Technical Breakdown  

### Workflow  
1. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Null value handling  
   - Binary encoding (spam=0, ham=1)  
2. **Feature Engineering**:  
   - TF-IDF with English stop words  
3. **Model Training**:  
   - 80/20 data split  
   - Logistic Regression implementation  

### Performance  
| Metric        | Score   |  
|---------------|---------|  
| Training Accuracy | 96.7% |  
| Testing Accuracy  | 96.6% |  

---

## Development Setup  

### Requirements  
- Python 3.8+  
- pandas | numpy | scikit-learn  

```bash  
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-detector.git  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

---

## Implementation Example  

```python  
# Initialize classifier  
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(min_df=1, stop_words='english')  
model = LogisticRegression()  

# Predict spam  
sample_email = ["Congratulations! You've won a $500 Amazon gift card"]  
features = vectorizer.transform(sample_email)  
print("Spam" if model.predict(features)[0] == 0 else "Legitimate")  
```

---

## Why It Works  
- **TF-IDF**: Prioritizes rare, meaningful words over common terms  
- **Logistic Regression**: Efficient for binary classification tasks  
- **Clean Pipeline**: Minimal dependencies, maximum reproducibility  

---

## Roadmap  
- [ ] Cross-validation for model robustness  
- [ ] Docker containerization  
- [ ] Precision/recall metrics analysis  
- [ ] Flask API integration
